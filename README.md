## NextJS Caching (App Directory)

Next.js provides powerful caching mechanisms in the app directory to optimize performance, reduce server load, and improve user experience. Hereâ€™s what you need to know:

### 1. Data Fetching and Caching

- **Server Components**: By default, data fetched in Server Components is cached and reused across requests, unless you opt out.
- **`fetch` Caching**: The built-in `fetch` API in the app directory supports caching options via the `cache` and `next` options:
    - `cache: 'force-cache'` (default): Caches the response indefinitely until the deployment is invalidated.
    - `cache: 'no-store'`: Disables caching; fetches fresh data on every request.
    - `next: { revalidate: seconds }`: Enables Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR), revalidating the cache after the specified number of seconds.

    ```js
    // Example: ISR with 60 seconds revalidation
    export default async function Page() {
        const res = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data', {
            next: { revalidate: 60 }
        });
        const data = await res.json();
        // ...
    }
    ```

### 2. Route Segment Caching

- Each route segment in the app directory can have its own caching and revalidation strategy.
- You can use the `revalidate` export in a route or layout to control how often the content is regenerated.

    ```js
    // app/page.js
    export const revalidate = 300; // Revalidate every 5 minutes
    ```

### 3. Static and Dynamic Rendering

- **Static Rendering**: Pages and components without dynamic data are statically generated and cached at build time.
- **Dynamic Rendering**: Use `cache: 'no-store'` or dynamic route parameters to opt out of static caching and always render on the server.

### 4. On-Demand Revalidation

- You can trigger cache revalidation manually using the [On-Demand Revalidation API](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/revalidating#on-demand-revalidation), useful for updating content after CMS changes or webhooks.

### 5. HTTP Caching Headers

- Next.js automatically sets HTTP caching headers for statically generated assets.
- You can customize headers using the `headers` config in `next.config.js` for advanced scenarios.

### 6. Client Components

- Client Components do not have built-in caching for data fetching; you should use client-side state management or libraries like SWR or React Query for caching on the client.

### 7. Best Practices

- Prefer static or ISR caching for public, non-user-specific data.
- Use `no-store` for user-specific or frequently changing data.
- Use revalidation to balance freshness and performance.
- Avoid sensitive data in cached responses.

## Other stuff
- metadata can only be done in server components not client components
### 8. Server Actions in Next.js (App Router)

- **Server Actions** are asynchronous functions that run on the server and can be invoked directly from Client Components or forms in the app directory.
- They enable secure data mutations (like creating, updating, or deleting data) without exposing sensitive logic to the client.
- Server Actions are defined using the `async` keyword and must be exported from Server Components or route handlers.

    ```js
    // app/actions.js
    'use server';

    export async function createPost(formData) {
      // Perform server-side logic, e.g., database write
    }
    ```

- You can call Server Actions from forms using the `action` prop or directly from Client Components with the `useTransition` or `useOptimistic` hooks.

    ```jsx
    // app/page.js (Client Component)
    import { createPost } from './actions';

    export default function Page() {
      return (
        <form action={createPost}>
          <input name="title" />
          <button type="submit">Create Post</button>
        </form>
      );
    }
    ```

- **Benefits:**
  - Simplifies data mutations by keeping logic on the server.
  - Reduces API boilerplate and improves security.
  - Integrates seamlessly with React Server Components and the App Router.
